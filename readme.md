# GAIA CORRUPTOR SPADE IMPOLUTTA

This game was created for the **Shroom Jam**, using "corruptions" as a theme. The way I applied the theme was corrupting the entire level in various ways so you can achieve (or deny) your main goal.

## The Game

You assume the role of a thief who stole a divine sword capable of destroying entire worlds. Be careful, because you can even kill yourself!

This project was proudly made on **Godot Engine 4.2**.
